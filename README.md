# ECS289G-HQ-SAM-Style-Transfer

This is the course project for ECS289G AI. 
We compared the object segmentation ability of SAM and HQ-SAM on the subset of the DIS5K dataset.
We piped the object segmented into a style transfer model named Multi-style Generative Network for Real-time Transfer.
After the style transfer, we combined the style-transferred object with the original background.
